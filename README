MailBuddy Profiles

While this might not be too intuitive to some users, each character that you log on will have its own initial Postal profile (settings). 
If you wish that some or all your characters share the same profile (and hence share the same contact list), 
then you can create a New Profile, call it anything you want such as "Shared by Alts", 
and have all your other characters change to that profile.
Mass Mailing Abilities

MailBuddy does not come with any abilities to send out mass mails (i.e. messages to more than 1 person at a time). 
There is no intention to add such functionality to Postal.
